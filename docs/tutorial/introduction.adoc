== Introduction

TODO: Link the resulting application code repository in this section when it gets published.

This tutorial explains how to use Polymer elements in Angular 2 applications with the help of the [literal]`https://github.com/vaadin/angular2-polymer[@vaadin/angular2-polymer]` directives.

For this purpose, we show how to create a staff management application similar to the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/[Tour of Heroes] example. But unlike in the Angular 2 Tour of Heroes, instead of implementing the UI elements in place, we will use the ready-made UI elements that are built on top of the Web Components technology stack. The resulting application will have a nice-looking mobile-first Material designed UI.

=== The Start Point

This tutorial is based on the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html[5 min QuickStart] for Angular 2 and the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/[Angular 2 Tour of Heroes]. We start from the QuickStart application source.

If you are not yet familiar with Angular 2, we advice you to first walk through the Angular 2 QuickStart and the Tour of Heroes. In this tutorial, we skip the explanations that are already given in the Angular 2 tutorials.

=== The Goal

In our heroes management application, there will be two UI screens. The first screen, as illustrated in <<figure.vaadin-angular2-polymer.tutorial.result-heroes-list>>, uses https://vaadin.com/elements/-/element/vaadin-grid[Vaadin Grid] to show a list of all the heroes.

By clicking on a grid row, the user can open the hero details editor screen. It is made using [elementname]#paper-input# and [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker#:

Both screens have a context-sensitive toolbar at the top, containing the title and the optional back icon button.
