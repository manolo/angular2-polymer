== Wrap Up

You have now finished all the tutorial steps and know how to use all the powers of Polymer elements in your Angular 2 applications.

TODO: Link the resulting application code repository in this section when it gets published.

=== Further Steps

There are several ways to improve the application you created in this tutorial. For example, you might want to add an explicit [guibutton]#Save# button to the hero detail editor and make the user able to intentionally submit or discard their changes. To do that, you can use the `ngForm` directive. See the https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html[Forms Chapter] in the Angular 2 Basics guide for the detailed instructions.

In the tutorial, we did not consider the topic of storing your application data. For simplicity, our application uses mock in-memory data and relies on data binding to make temporary changes, which are not saved anywhere. You might want to move the heroes data to a server and add some HTTP API calls in your application. See the Angular 2 https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html[Http Client] documentation to know how to do that.
